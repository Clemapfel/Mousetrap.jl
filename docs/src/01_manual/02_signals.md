## Signal Architecture

Central to Mousetrap, as well as other GUI libraries like [GTK4](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/) and Qt, is **signal architecture**, or [**signal programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_programming), which is a type of software architecture that triggers behavior using signals.

A **signal**, in this context, has three components:
+ an **ID**, which uniquely identifies it. IDs may not be shared between signals
+ an **emitter**, which is a non-signal object
+ a **callback** or **signal handler**, which is a function called when an emitter emits a signal

It may be easiest to consider an example:

One of the simpler interactions with a GUI is clicking a button. In Mousetrap, the [`Button`](@ref) class is made for this purpose. `Button` has the signal `clicked`, which is emitted when a user presses the left mouse button while the cursor hovers over the graphical element of the button.

In this case, the signals' **ID** is `clicked`, while the signal **emitter** is an instance of `Button`. When a user clicks the button, the in-memory object emits signal `clicked`. 

If we want to tie program behavior to the user clicking the button, we **connect a callback** (a function) to this signal. Once connected, when the button is clicked, `clicked` is emitted, which in turn will trigger invocation of the connected function:

```julia
# create `Button` instance
button = Button()

# create a signal handler
on_clicked(self::Button) = println("clicked")

# connect signal handler to the signal
connect_signal_clicked!(on_clicked, button)
```

Which can also be written more succinctly using [do-syntax](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Do-Block-Syntax-for-Function-Arguments):

```julia
button = Button()
connect_signal_clicked!(button) do self::Button
    println("clicked")
end
```

!!! details "Running Code Snippets"

    In this section, code snippets will only show the relevant lines. To compile and run the code stated here, we need to create a Julia script with the following content:

    ```julia
    using Mousetrap
    main() do app::Application
        window = Window(app)

        # code snippet goes here

        set_child!(window, widget) # add whatever widget the code snippet is about here
        present!(window)
    end
    ```

    For example, to execute the example snippet above, we would create the following `main.jl` file:

    ```jldoctest; output = false
    using Mousetrap
    main() do app::Application
        window = Window(app)

        # snippet start
        button = Button()
        connect_signal_clicked!(button) do self::Button
            println("clicked")
        end
        # snippet end

        set_child!(window, button) # add the button to the window
        present!(window)
    end
    # output
    0
    ```

    Then execute it from the console by calling `julia main.jl`

When we execute this code, we see that a small window opens that contains our button. By clicking it, we get:

```
clicked
```

Only one callback can be connected to each signal of a signal emitter. If we call `connect_signal_clicked!` again with a new callback, the old callback will be overridden. If we want to trigger two functions, `callback_01` and `callback_02` at the same time, we can simply do the following:

```julia
callback_01() = # ...
callback_02() = # ...

# call both functions from the signal handler
connect_signal_clicked!(button) do self::Button
    callback_01()
    callback_02()
end
```

## SignalEmitters

`Button`, like most classes in Mousetrap, is a subtype of an abstract type called [`SignalEmitter`](@ref). 

Subtyping `SignalEmitter` is equivalent to saying "This object can emit signals". Not all objects in Mousetrap are signal emitters, but most are. 

When we say "an object can emit signal `<id>`", what that means is that the following functions are defined for that object:

+ `connect_signal_<id>!`
+ `disconnect_signal_<id>!`
+ `emit_signal_<id>`
+ `set_signal_<id>_blocked!`
+ `get_signal_<id>_blocked`

For example, `Button` supports the signal with ID `clicked`, so the following functions are defined for it:

+ `connect_signal_clicked!`
+ `disconnect_signal_clicked!`
+ `emit_signal_clicked`
+ `set_signal_clicked_blocked!`
+ `get_signal_clicked_blocked`


We'll now go through what each of these functions does and how to use them.

---

## Connecting Signal Handlers

Above, we've already seen an example of how to connect a signal handler to a signal using `connect_signal_clicked!`. 

What may not have been obvious is that the signal handler, the anonymous function in the above code snippet, is required to **conform to a specific signature**.

!!! note "Function Signature Syntax" 
    
    A function's **signature** describes a function's return- and argument types. For example, the function

    ```julia
    function foo(i::Int32, s::String) ::String
        return string(i) * s
    end
    ```
    
    Has the signature `(::Int32, ::String) -> String`.  It takes a 32-bit integer and a string, and it returns a string.

    The anonymous function from this do-block:

    ```julia
    connect_signal_clicked!(button) do self::Button
        println("clicked")
    end
    ```

    has the signature `(::Button) -> Nothing`. It takes an instance of type `Button` and returns `nothing`.

    For a function with an optional argument like this:

    ```julia
    function foo_optional(i::Int32, string::String, optional::Bool = true) ::String
        return string(i) * string * string(optional)
    end
    ```

    We convey that the last argument is optional by enclosing it in `[]`: `(::Int32, ::String, [::Bool]) -> String`

    In general, a function with argument types `Arg1_t, Arg2_t, ...`, return type `Return_t`, and optional arguments `Optional1_t, Optional2_t` has the signature 
    ```
    (Arg1_t, Arg2_t, ..., [Optional1_t, Optional2_t, ...]) -> Return_t`.
    ```

    If and only if the `Return_t` of a function is `Nothing`, we can omit the return types along with the trailing `->`.


Each signal requires it's a callback to conform to a specific signature. This signature is different for each signal. If we attempt to connect a handler that has the wrong signature, an `AssertionError` will be thrown at compile time. This makes it important to know how to check which signal requires which signature. 

## Checking Signal Signature

Working with our example, signal `clicked` of class `Button`, let's say we do not know what function signature this signal expects.
To find out, we check the Mousetrap documentation, either by visiting [`Button`](@ref)s documentation online, or from within the REPL by pressing `?` and entering the name of the class we want to look up:

```
help?> Mousetrap.Button
```
```  
  Button <: Widget
  ≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

  Button with a label. Connect to signal clicked or specify an action via set_action! in order to
  react to the user clicking the button.

  Constructors
  ==============

  Button()
  Button(label::Widget)
  Button(::Icon)

  Signals
  =========

  │  clicked
  │  ---------
  │
  │  │  (::Button, [::Data_t]) -> Nothing
  │
  │  Emitted when the user clicks a widget using a mouse or touchscreen.

  Fields
  ========

  (no public fields)

  Example
  =========

  button = Button()
  set_child!(button, Label("Click Me"))
  connect_signal_clicked!(button) do x::Button
      println("clicked!")
  end
  set_child!(window, button)
```

We see that button has a single signal, `clicked`. Along with this information, a description of when that signal is emitted is given, and that it requires the signature `(::Button, [::Data_t]) -> Nothing`, where `Data_t` is an optional argument of arbitrary type, which we can use to hand data to the signal handler.

## Handing Data to Signal Handlers

While we do get passed the signal emitter instance as the first argument to the signal handler, `::Button` in this case, we will often need to reference other objects. This may necessitate accessing global variables, which [is discouraged in Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-untyped-global-variables).

Instead, Mousetrap allows adding an optional, arbitrarily typed, *single* argument to the end of any signal handler signature. This object is often referred to as `data`, its type will therefore be called `Data_t`.

Expanding on our previous example, if we want to send a customized message when the user clicks our button, we can change the signal handler as follows:

```julia
button = Button()

# new signal handler that takes two arguments
on_clicked(self::Button, data) = println(data)  

# connect the signal handler, providing a third argument as `data`
connect_signal_clicked!(on_clicked, button, "custom message")
```

Or, using do-syntax:

```julia
button = Button()
connect_signal_clicked!(button, "custom message") do self::Button, data
    println(data)
end
```

By clicking the button, we now get:

```
custom message
```

Any and all objects can be provided as `data`, but they have to be packaged as exactly **one** argument.

### Grouping Data Arguments

Because there is only one `data`, it may seem limiting as to what or how much data we can pass to the signal handlers. In practice, this is not true, 
because we can use a simple trick to group any number of objects into a single argument.

Let's say we want to forward a string `"abc"`, an integer `999`, and a vector of floats `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` to the signal handler. To achieve this, we can do the following:

```julia
button = Button()

function on_clicked(self::Button, data)
    println(data.string_value)
    println(data.integer_value)
    println(data.vector_value)
end

# create a named tuple that groups the arguments
named_tuple = (
    string_value = "abc",
    integer_value = 999,
    vector_value = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
)

# provide the named tuple as
connect_signal_clicked!(on_clicked, button, named_tuple)
```

Here, we grouped the values in a [named tuple](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Named-Tuple-Types), then accessed each value using an
easy-to-read name.

Again, we can write the above more succinctly using do-syntax:

```julia
button = Button()
connect_signal_clicked!(button, (
    string_value = "abc", integer_value = 999, vector_value = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
)) do self::Button, data
    println(data.string_value)
    println(data.integer_value)
    println(data.vector_value)
end
```

Using this technique, we can forward any objects to the signal handler via the optional `[::Data_t]` argument. This technique is available for all signals.

## Implicit Return Types

Julia allows functions to return a value without using the `return` keyword. This may cause side effects in applications where functions are required to conform to a specific signature. Consider the following example:

```julia
button = Button()

to_append = []
function on_clicked(self::Button)
    push!(to_append, 1234)
end

connect_signal_clicked!(on_clicked, button)
```

Here we are appending a value to `to_append`, a vector, from within the signal handler for signal `clicked`, which is required to have the signature:

```julia
(::Button, [::Data_t]) -> Nothing
```

`on_clicked`, in this example, does not explicitly return a value, yet running the above code we get:

```
[ERROR] In Mousetrap.main: AssertionError: Object `on_clicked` is not invokable as function with signature `(Button) -> Nothing`, because its return type is not `Nothing`
```

This is because `Base.push!` actually **does** return a value, the vector it is operating on:

```julia
to_append = []
out = push!(to_append, 1234)
out == to_append # true
```

Because `push!` returns a value and it is the last line of the `on_clicked` definition, `on_clicked`, in turn, returns a value, meaning its return type is no longer `Nothing`, which triggers the error.

In Mousetrap, all functions whose documentation does not explicitly mention a return type will return `nothing`. This may not be true for functions in `Base` or foreign libraries, so we should take care to be aware of implicit return types. 

To fix the above error, we should return `nothing` manually:

```julia
to_append = []
function on_clicked(self::Button)
    push!(to_append, 1234)
    return nothing
end
connect_signal_clicked!(on_clicked, button) # works
```

---

## Blocking Signal Emission

If we want an object to *not* call the signal handler on signal emission, we have two options:

Using `disconnect_signal_<id>`, we can **disconnect** the signal, which will permanently remove the registered signal handler, deallocating it and fully dissociating it from the original signal emitter instance. This is a quite costly operation and should only rarely be necessary. 

A much more performant and convenient method to **temporarily** prevent signal emission is  **blocking** the signal.

Blocking a signal will prevent the invocation of the signal handler. This means, for our `Button` example, once we call:

```julia
set_signal_clicked_blocked(button, true)
```

The user can still click the button, but the connected handler is not called.

To block a signal, we use `set_signal_<id>_blocked!`, which takes a boolean as its second argument. We can check whether a signal is currently blocked using `get_signal_<id>_blocked`. If no signal handler is connected, this function will return `true`.

### Signal Blocking: An Example

When is blocking necessary? Consider the following use-case:

```julia
# declare two buttons
button_01 = Button()
button_02 = Button()

# when button 01 is clicked, 02 is triggered programmatically
connect_signal_clicked!(button_01, button_02) do button_01::Button, button_02::Button
    # button_01 is self, button_02 is data
    println("01 clicked")
    emit_signal_clicked(button_02)
end

# when button 02 is clicked, 01 is triggered programmatically
connect_signal_clicked!(button_02, button_01) do button_02::Button, button_01::Button
    # button_02 is self, button_01 is data
    println("02 clicked")
    emit_signal_clicked(button_01)
end

# add both buttons to the window
set_child!(window, hbox(button_01, button_02))
```

In which we use [`emit_signal_clicked`](@ref), which manually triggers emission of signal `clicked`.  

[`hbox`](@ref) in the last line makes it so that we can display both buttons in the window.

The intended behavior is that if the user clicks either one of the buttons, both buttons emit their signal. Clicking one button should always trigger both, regardless of which button is clicked first.

Running the above code as-is and clicking `button_01`, we get the following output:

```
01 clicked
02 clicked
01 clicked
02 clicked
01 clicked
02 clicked
01 clicked
02 clicked
...
```

And our application deadlocks. This is, of course, extremely undesirable, so let's talk through why this happens.

When `button_01` is clicked, it emits signal `clicked`, which invokes the connected signal handler. Going line-by-line through the handler :
+ `button_01`s handler prints `"01 clicked"`
+ `button_01`s handler activates `button_02`, triggering emission of signal `clicked` on `button_02`
+ `button_02`s handler prints `"02 clicked"`
+ `button_02`s handler activates `button_01`, triggering emission of signal `clicked` on `button_01`
+ `button_01`'s handler prints `"01 clicked"`
+ etc.

We created an infinite loop.

We can avoid this behavior by **blocking signals** at strategic times:

```julia
button_01 = Button()
button_02 = Button()

connect_signal_clicked!(button_01, button_02) do button_01::Button, button_02::Button
    println("01 clicked")
    
    # block self (01)
    set_signal_clicked_blocked!(button_01, true)

    # activate other (02)
    emit_signal_clicked(button_02)

    # unblock self (01)
    set_signal_clicked_blocked!(button_01, false)
end

connect_signal_clicked!(button_02, button_01) do button_02::Button, button_01::Button
    println("02 clicked")

    # block self (02)
    set_signal_clicked_blocked!(button_02, true)

    # activate other (01)
    emit_signal_clicked(button_01)

    # unblock self (02)
    set_signal_clicked_blocked!(button_02, false)
end

set_child!(window, hbox(button_01, button_02))
```

Let's talk through what happens when the user clicks one of the two buttons now, again assuming `button_01` is the first to be clicked:

+ `button_01` invokes its signal handler
+ `button_01`s signal handler prints `01 clicked`
+ `button_01` blocks invocation of its signal handler
+ `button_01` activates `button_02`, triggering emission of signal `clicked`
+ `button_02`s signal handler prints `02 clicked`
+ `button_02` blocks invocation of its signal handler
+ `button_02` attempts to activate `button_01`, **but that buttons signal is blocked, so nothing happens**
+ `button_02` unblocks itself
+ `button_01` unblocks itself
+ both signal handlers return normally 

```
01 clicked
02 clicked
```

By blocking signals, we get the correct behavior of both buttons being triggered exactly once. Because they unblock themselves at the end of the signal handler, after the two buttons are done, everything returns to the way it was before, meaning both buttons can be clicked once again.

To verify this is indeed the resulting behavior, we can use the following `main.jl`:

```jldoctest; output = false
using Mousetrap
main() do app::Application
    window = Window(app)
    
    button_01 = Button()
    button_02 = Button()

    connect_signal_clicked!(button_01, button_02) do button_01::Button, button_02::Button
        println("01 clicked")
        
        set_signal_clicked_blocked!(button_01, true)
        emit_signal_clicked(button_02)
        set_signal_clicked_blocked!(button_01, false)
    end

    connect_signal_clicked!(button_02, button_01) do button_02::Button, button_01::Button
        println("02 clicked")

        set_signal_clicked_blocked!(button_02, true)
        emit_signal_clicked(button_01)
        set_signal_clicked_blocked!(button_02, false)
    end

    set_child!(window, hbox(button_01, button_02))
    present!(window)
end
# output
0
```
