# Chapter 3: Actions

In this chapter, we will learn:
+ How and why to use the command pattern to encapsulate application functionality
+ How to create and use `Action`
+ How to trigger actions using `Button`, or by pressing a keyboard shortcut

---

## Introduction: The Command Pattern

As we create more and more complex applications, keeping track of how / when to trigger which functionality gets harder and harder. An application can have hundreds, if not thousands, of functions, all linked to one or more triggers such as buttons, menus, keyboard shortcuts, etc. 

Things will get out of hand very quickly, which is why there's a software design pattern just for this purpose: the [**command pattern**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern).

A **command**, henceforth called **action**, is an object that has the following components:
+ A **function**, which is the action's behavior
+ An **ID** that uniquely identifies the action
+ An optional **shortcut trigger**, also often called a keybinding

In Mousetrap, a command is represented by the type [`Action`](@ref).

## Action

As early as possible, we should drop the habit of defining application behavior inside a global function. Unless a function is used exactly once, it should be an action.

For example, in the previous chapter, we declared a [`Button`](@ref) with the following behavior:

```julia
button = Button()
connect_signal_clicked!(button) do self::Button
    println("clicked")
end
```

In this section, we will learn how to reproduce this behavior using the command pattern and why we should prefer this over connecting a signal handler for signal `clicked`.

### Action IDs

When creating an action, we first need to choose the action's **ID**. An ID is an identifier that uniquely identifies the action. The ID can only contain the character `[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]`, that is, all Roman letters, numbers `0` to `9`, `_`, `-` and `.`. The dot is usually reserved to simulate scoping. 

For example, one action could be called `image_file.save`, while another is called `text_file.save`. Both actions say what they do, `save` a file, but the prefix makes it clear which part of the application they act on.

An appropriate ID for our button behavior would therefore be `example.print_clicked`. 

### Action Function

Armed with this ID, we can create an action:

```julia
action = Action("example.print_clicked", app)
```
Where `app` is the application instance from our `main`.

The second part of an action is its function, also called its callback. We assign an actions function using [`set_function!`](@ref):

```julia
function on_example_print_clicked(x::Action) ::Nothing
    println("clicked")
end

action = Action("example.print_clicked", app)
set_function!(on_example_print_clicked, action)
```

or, using do-syntax:

```julia
action = Action("example.print_clicked", app)
set_function!(action) do x::Action
    println("clicked")
end
```

The function registered using `set_function!` is required to have the following signature:

```julia
(::Action, [::Data_t]) -> Nothing
```

We see that, much like with signal handlers, the callback is provided the `Action` instance, along with an optional `data` argument.

`Action` also provides a constructor that directly takes the function as its first argument. Using this, we can write the above even more succinctly:

```julia
action = Action("example.print_clicked", app) do x::Action
    println("clicked")
end
```

### Triggering Actions

At any point, we can call [`activate!`](@ref) to trigger the actions' callback. This is not the only way to trigger an action, however. 

`Button` provides [`set_action!`](@ref), which makes it such that when the button is clicked, the action is triggered:

```julia
action = Action("example.print_clicked", app)
set_function!(action) do x::Action
    println("clicked")
end

button = Button()
set_action!(button, action)
```
```
clicked
```

So far, this doesn't seem to have any upsides over just connecting to signal `clicked`. This is about to change.

## Disabling Actions

Similarly to how blocking signals work, we can disable an action using [`set_enabled!`](@ref). If set to `false`, calling `activate!` will trigger no behavior. Furthermore, **all objects the action is connected to are automatically disabled**. This means we do not need to keep track of which button calls which action. To disable all of them, we can simply disable the action. 

## Action Maps

We recall that `Action`s constructor requires an instance of our `Application` as its second argument. This is because the two are linked internally, all actions are registered with the application and are accessible only from within that application. In this way, `Application` itself acts as an **action map**, an index of all actions.

Once `set_function!` was called, we can, at any point, retrieve the action from the application using `get_action!`:

```julia
let action = Action("example.print_clicked", app)
    set_function!(action) do x::Action
        println("clicked")
    end
end

# `action` is no longer defined here because of `let`

activate!(get_action(app, "example.print_clicked"))

# but we can retrieve it anyway
```
```
clicked
```

Where we used a [let-block](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#let) to create a "hard" scope, meaning at the end of the block, `action`, the Julia-side object, is no longer defined. We can nonetheless retrieve it by calling `get_action!` on our `Application` instance.

This way, we do not have to keep track of actions ourselves; by simply remembering the action's ID, we can, at any point, trigger the action from anywhere in our application.

## Shortcuts

An action can have any number of optional **shortcut triggers**, which are also called **keybindings**. 

A keybinding is a combination of keyboard keys that, when pressed, trigger an action exactly once. Common keyboard shortcuts familiar to most users of modern operating systems are `Control + C` to copy, `Control + A` to "select all", etc. 

Most of the time, we will have to implement behavior like this and associate a shortcut with it manually, using actions.

### Shortcut Trigger Syntax

Before we can learn about keybindings, we need to talk about keys. In Mousetrap, keyboard keys
are split into two groups: **modifiers**  and **non-modifiers**.

A modifier is one of the following:
+ `Shift`
+ `Control`
+ `Alt`

!!! note 
    Additional modifiers include `CapsLock`, `AltGr`, `Meta`, `Apple`, and `Win`. These are keyboard-layout and/or OS-specific. See [here](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk4/flags.ModifierType.html) for more information.

A non-modifier, then, is any key that is not a modifier.

A keybinding, or **shortcut trigger**, henceforth also called "shortcut", is the combination of **any number of modifiers, along with exactly one non-modifier key**. A few examples:

+ `a` (that is the `A` keyboard key) is a shortcut
+ `<Control><Shift>plus` (that is the `+` keyboard key, along with the `Control` and `Shift` modifiers) is a shortcut
+ `<Alt><Control><Shift>` is **not** a shortcut, because it does not contain a non-modifier
+ `<Control>xy` (that is the `X` key *and* the `Y` key) is **not** a shortcut because it contains more than one non-modifier key

Shortcuts are represented as strings, which have a specific syntax. As seen above, each modifier is enclosed in `<``>`, with no spaces in between. After the group of modifiers, the non-modifier key is placed after the last modifier`>`. Some more examples:

+ "Control + C" is written `<Control>c`
+ "Alt + LeftArrow" is written as `<Alt>Left` (sic, `L` is capitalized)
+ "Shift + 1" is written as `exclam`

That last one requires an explanation. On most keyboard layouts, to type `!`, the user has to press the shift modifier key, then press the `1` key. When "Shift + 1" is pressed,  Mousetrap does not receive this keyboard key event as-is, instead, it receives a single key event for the `!` key with no modifiers. The identifier of `!` is `exclam`, hence why "Shift + 1" is written as `exclam`.

!!! tip "Looking up Key Identifiers"

    An example of how to look up the identifier of any key will be performed here.

    Let's say we want to write the shortcut "Control + Space". We know that we can write "Control" as `<Control>`. Next, we navigate to [https://github.com/Clemapfel/mousetrap.jl/blob/main/src/key_codes.jl](https://github.com/Clemapfel/mousetrap.jl/blob/main/src/key_codes.jl), 
    which has a list of all keys recognized by Mousetrap. In [line 1039](https://github.com/Clemapfel/mousetrap.jl/blob/main/src/key_codes.jl#L1039), we find that the constant for the space key is called `KEY_space`. The identifier of a key used for shortcuts is this name, without the `KEY_` prefix. For the space bar key, the enum value is `KEY_space`, the identifier is therefore `space`.

    One more obscure example: to write "Alt + Beta", that is, the `Î²` key on the somewhat rare Greek keyboard layout, we find the constant named `KEY_Greek_BETA` in [line 3034](https://github.com/Clemapfel/mousetrap.jl/blob/main/src/key_codes.jl#L3034). Erasing `KEY_` again, the key's identifier is `Greek_BETA`. "Alt + Beta" is therefore written as `<Alt>Greek_BETA`

    If we make an error and use the wrong identifier, a soft warning will be printed at runtime, informing us of this. 

    To access a list of key codes from within the REPL, we can search the vector `Mousetrap.key_codes`, which contains the symbols of all key codes recognized by Mousetrap, with the `KEY_` prefix already removed:
    ```julia
    julia> Mousetrap.key_codes
        2278-element Vector{Symbol}:
        :0
        :1
        :2
        :3
        ...
    ```

!!! warning "Operating System Priority"
    Depending on the operating system, some shortcuts will already be assigned. If this is the case, we should take care not to use them in our application. For example, the abovementioned `<Control>space` shortcut [is reserved for changing input sources on macOS](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8507324), while on Windows `<Control><Alt>Delete` will always open the task manager.

### Assigning Shortcuts to Actions

Now that we know how to write a shortcut as a shortcut trigger string, we can assign it to our actions. For this, we use [`add_shortcut!`](@ref):

```julia
shortcut_action = Action("example.shortcut_action", app) do self::Action
    println("shortcut action called")
end
add_shortcut!(shortcut_action, "<Control>M")
```

An action can have multiple shortcuts, and one shortcut can be associated with two or more actions, though the latter is usually not recommended.

We need one more thing before we can trigger our action: an object that can receive keyboard key events. We will learn much more about the event model [in the chapter dedicated to it](./05_event_handling.md). For now, we can use [`set_listens_for_shortcut_action!`](@ref) on our top-level window. This makes the window instance listen for any keyboard presses. If it recognizes that a keybinding associated with an action it is listening for was pressed, it will trigger that action.

A complete `main.jl` file showing how to trigger an action using a shortcut is given here:

```jldoctest; output = false
using Mousetrap
main() do app::Application
    # create a window
    window = Window(app)

    # create an action that prints `shortcut action called`
    action = Action("example.shortcut_action", app) do action::Action
        println("shortcut action called")
    end

    # add the shortcut `Control + M`
    add_shortcut!(action, "<Control>M")
    
    # make `window` listen for all shortcuts of `action`
    set_listens_for_shortcut_action!(window, action)

    # show the window to the user
    present!(window)
end
# output
0
```

Pressing "Control + M", we get:

```
shortcut action called
```
